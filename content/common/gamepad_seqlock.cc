// The algorithm works as follows.
// The SeqLock contains 2 user objects - a current and a non-current.
// The object roles can be swapped by incrementing the current_ variable.
// Initially both objects are consistent, that is, their sequence_%2 == 0.
// A writer proceeds as follows. First, it marks the non-current object
// as inconsistent by incrementing it's sequence_ (the sequence_ becomes odd).
// Then it mutates the object. Then marks it as consistent by incrementing
// it's sequence_ once again (the sequence_ is even now). And finally swaps
// the object roles, that is, the object becomes current.
// Such disipline establishes an important property - the current object
// is always consistent and contains the most recent data.
// Readers proceed as follows. First, determine what is the current object,
// remember it's seqence, check that the sequence is even
// (the object is consistent), copy out the object, verify that
// the sequence is not changed. If any of the checks fail, a reader works
// with a non-current object (current object is always consistent), so it
// just retries from the beginning. Thus readers are completely lock-free,
// that is, a reader retries iff a writer has accomplished a write operation
// during reading (only constant sequence of writes can stall readers,
// a stalled writer can't block readers).
