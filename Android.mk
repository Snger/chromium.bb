# This Android makefile is used to build WebView in the Android build system.
# gyp autogenerates most of the real makefiles, which we just include here if
# we are doing a WebView build. For other builds, this makefile does nothing,
# which prevents the Android build system from mistakenly loading any other
# Android.mk that may exist in the Chromium tree.
