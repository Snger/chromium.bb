/*
 * Models instructions and decode results.
 *
 * Implementation Note:
 * All the classes in this file are designed to be fully inlined as 32-bit
 * integers.  The goal: to provide a nice, fluent interface for describing
 * instruction bit operations, with zero runtime cost.  Compare:
 *
 *   return (1 << ((insn >> 12) & 0xF)) | (1 << ((insn >> 19) & 0xF));
 *
 *   return insn.reg(15,12) + insn.reg(19,16);
 *
 * Both lines compile to the same machine code, but the second one is easier
 * to read, and eliminates a common error (using X in place of 1 << X).
 *
 * To this end, keep the following in mind:
 *  - Avoid virtual methods.
 *  - Mark all methods as inline.  Small method bodies may be included here,
 *    but anything nontrivial should go in model-inl.h.
 *  - Do not declare destructors.  A destructor causes an object to be passed
 *    on the stack, even when passed by value.  (This may be a GCC bug.)
 *    Adding a destructor to Instruction slowed the decoder down by 10% on
 *    gcc 4.3.3.
