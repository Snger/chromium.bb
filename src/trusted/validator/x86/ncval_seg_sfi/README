This directory contains the code for the native client verifier (ncv)
which checks whether binaries adhere to certain control flow
and instruction set restrictions. It assumes that segment registers
are used to control memory accesses.

Note: Although the current builds generate 64-bit versions, they do not
make any sense, since segment registers have little effect in x86-64.
