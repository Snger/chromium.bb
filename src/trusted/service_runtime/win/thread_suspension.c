 * NaClUntrustedThreadsSuspend() ensures that any untrusted code is

 * hole in untrusted address space.  In this case, if another trusted
 * thread (outside of control) allocates memory that is placed into
 * that hole, we do not want untrusted code to being to write to that
 * location.
 *
 * If a thread is currently executing a NaCl syscall, we tell the
 * thread not to return to untrusted code yet.  If a thread is
 * currently executing untrusted code, we suspend it.
 *
 * This returns with the lock threads_mu held, because we need to pin
 * the list of threads.  NaClUntrustedThreadsResume() must be called
