Description:
Provides toolchain binaries for building 64-bit Windows object files.

Currently NaCl uses mingw-64's version of GNU "as" assembler because
it seems to be the only gnu-compatible assembler capable of emitting
64-bit COFF/PE+ object files.

Since we are using only the compiled executable and no static libraries,
the LGPL's linking requirements would appear to be met.
