Catapult
========

Catapult is currently under construction! But when it is here, it will be a set
of tools for performance analysis, testing, and monitoring:
 * [Trace-viewer](
    https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool)
 * [Telemetry](https://www.chromium.org/developers/telemetry)
 * [Performance Dashboard](https://chromeperf.appspot.com/)

These tools were created by Chromium developers for performance debugging and
testing of Chrome, but they can also be used for analyzing and monitoring
websites, and eventually Android apps.

For background, see [Chrome Speed Infra](http://www.chromium.org/developers/speed-infra)
