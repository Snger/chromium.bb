   * Creation handler that is called when a new instance is created. It is

   * Generally you would handle this call by initializing the information
   * your module associates with an instance and creating a mapping from the
   * given PP_Instance handle to this data. The PP_Instance handle will be used
   * in subsequent calls to identify which instance the call pertains to.
   *

   * This means that you may get more than one OnCreate without an OnDestroy
   * in between, and should be prepared to maintain multiple states associated
   * with each instance.
   *
   * If this function reports a failure (by returning @a PP_FALSE), the
   * instance will be deleted.

   * @param[in] instance A new PP_Instance indentifying one instance of a
   * module. This is an opaque handle.

   * @param[in] argn An array of argument names.  These argument names are
   * supplied in the \<embed\> tag, for example:
   * <code>\<embed id="nacl_module" dimensions="2"\></code> will produce two
   * argument names: "id" and "dimensions."
   *
   * @param[in] argv An array of argument values.  These are the values of the
   * arguments listed in the \<embed\> tag, for example
   * <code>\<embed id="nacl_module" dimensions="2"\></code> will produce two
   * argument values: "nacl_module" and "2".  The indices of these values match

   * Generally you will handle this call by deallocating the tracking
   * information and the PP_Instance mapping you created in the DidCreate call.

   * required; all resources associated with the deleted instance will be

   * A pointer to a function that is called when the position, the size, or

   * A typical implementation will check the size of the @a position argument
   * and reallocate the graphics context when a different size is received.
   * Note that this function will be called for scroll events where the size
   * doesn't change, so you should always check that the size is actually
   * different before doing any reallocations.
   *
   * @param[in] instance A PP_Instance indentifying the instance that has
   * changed.
   *
   * @param[in] position The location on the page of the instance. This is
   * relative to the top left corner of the viewport, which changes as the
   * page is scrolled. Generally the size of this value will be used to create
   * a graphics device, and the position is ignored (most things are relative
   * to the instance so the absolute position isn't useful in most cases).
   *
   * @param[in] clip The visible region of the instance. This is relative to
   * the top left of the plugin's coordinate system (not the page).  If the
   * plugin is invisible, @a clip will be (0, 0, 0, 0).
   *
   * It's recommended to check for invisible instances and to stop
   * generating graphics updates in this case to save system resources. It's
   * not usually worthwhile, however, to generate partial updates according to
   * the clip when the instance is partially visible. Instead, update the entire
   * region. The time saved doing partial paints is usually not significant and
   * it can create artifacts when scrolling (this notification is sent
   * asynchronously from scolling so there can be flashes of old content in the
   * exposed regions).
