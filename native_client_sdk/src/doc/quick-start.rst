To get started with Native Client:

1. Read the :doc:`Technical Overview <overview>` to understand how a Native
   Client application is structured and to get a feel for what you need to do
   to port existing code.
2. Play with some of the applications in the `Application Gallery
   <https://developers.google.com/native-client/community/application-gallery>`_
   to see what others have done so far.
3. Download the :doc:`Native Client SDK <sdk/download>`.
4. Go through the `Getting Started Tutorial
   <https://developers.google.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial>`_. The
   tutorial walks you through how to get Native Client set up for the first
   time and check for browser version compatibility.
5. Take a look through some of the applications in the ``pepper_28/examples/``
   directory in the SDK. You can learn how to build and run the applications
   on the `Running the SDK Examples page
   <https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/sdk-examples>`_.
6. Browse through the `Developer's Guide
   <https://developers.google.com/native-client/devguide>`_ and the `Pepper
   API <https://developers.google.com/native-client/peppercpp/>`_ reference
   documentation.
