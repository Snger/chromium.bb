<p>The sandbox internals explains implementation details about Native
Client sandboxing, which is also used by Portable Native Client. These
details can be useful to reimplement a sandbox, or to write assembly
code that follows sandboxing rules for Native Client (Portable Native
Client doesn&#8217;t allow developers to write platform-specific assembly).</p>
