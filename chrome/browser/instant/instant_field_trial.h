// This class manages the Instant field trial. Each user is in exactly one of
// three field trial groups: Inactive, Control or Experiment.
// - Inactive users are those who have played with the Instant option in the
//   Preferences page, or those for whom group policy provides an override, or
//   those with an incognito profile, etc. The field trial is inactive for such
//   users, so their Instant preference setting is respected.
// - Control and Experiment are all the other users, i.e., those who have never
//   touched the Preferences option. Some percentage of these users are chosen
//   into the Experiment group and get Instant enabled automatically. The rest
//   fall into the Control group; for them, Instant remains disabled by default.
// - Control and Experiment are further split into two subgroups each, in order
//   to detect bias between them (when analyzing metrics). The subgroups are
//   treated identically for all other purposes.
