"PlayCanvas is a visual development platform for 3D web content. Both the
tools and the web apps you build are powered by HTML5. The entire software
platform is web hosted so there's nothing to install and you can access your
work from any device that runs one of the supported web browsers." - <a

PlayCanvas exports content that requires a small amount of manual work to
package into a Chrome App. See:
