<p>
The Declarative API is a framework to define rules consisting of declarative
conditions and actions. Conditions are evaluated in the browser rather than the
JavaScript engine which reduces roundtrip latencies and allows for very high
efficiency.
</p>

</p>The Declarative API is an abstract foundation for the <a
  href="declarativeWebRequest.html">Declarative Web Request API</a> and
possibly further extension APIs in the future. This page describes the
underlying concepts of all Declarative APIs.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must declare the "declarative" permission in your extension's manifest
to use APIs that are based on this API.
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "permissions": [
    "declarative",
  ]</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>The simplest possible rule consists of one or more conditions and one or more
actions:</p>
<pre>
var rule = {
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};
</pre>

<p>If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are executed.</p>

<p>In addition to conditions and actions you may give each rule an identifier,
which simplifies unregistering previously registered rules, and a priority to
define precedences among rules. Priorities are only considered if rules conflict
each other or need to be executed in a specific order.</p>

<pre>
var rule = {
  id: "my rule",  // optional, will be generated if not set.
  priority: 100,  // optional, defaults to 100.
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};
</pre>

<h2 id="eventobjects">Event objects</h2>

<p>
<a href="events.html">Event objects</a> may support rules. These event objects
don't call a callback function when events happer but test whether any
registered rule has at least one fulfilled condition and execute the actions
associated with this rule. Event objects supporting the declarative API have
three relevant methods: <a href="#method-addRules"><code>addRules()</code></a>,
<a href="#method-removeRules"><code>removeRules()</code></a>, and
<a href="#method-getRules"><code>getRules()</code></a>.
</p>

<h3 id="addingrules">Adding rules</h3>

<p>
To add rules call the <code>addRules()</code> function of the event object. It
takes an array of rule instances as its first parameter and a callback function
that is called on completion.
</p>

<pre>
var rule_list = [rule1, rule2, ...];
function addRules(rule_list, function callback(details) {...});
</pre>

<p>
If the rules were inserted successfully, the <code>details</code> parameter
contains an array of inserted rules appearing in the same order as in the passed
<code>rule_list</code> where the optional parameters <code>id</code> and
<code>priority</code> were filled with the generated values. If any rule is
invalid, e.g., because it contained an invalid condition or action, none of the
rules are added and the <a
  href="extension.html#property-lastError">lastError</a> variable is set when
the callback function is called. Each rule in <code>rule_list</code> must
contain a unique identifier that is not currently used by another rule or an
empty identifier.
</p>

<h3 id="removingrules">Removing rules</h3>

<p>
To remove rules call the <code>removeRules()</code> function. It accepts an
optional array of rule identifiers as its first parameter and a callback
function as its second parameter.
</p>

<pre>
var rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
function removeRules(rule_ids, function callback() {...});
</pre>

<p>
If <code>rule_ids</code> is an array of identifiers, all rules having
identifiers listed in the array are removed. If <code>rule_ids</code> lists an
identifier, that is unknown, this identifier is silently ignored. If
<code>rule_ids</code> is <code>undefined</code>, all registered rules of this
extension are removed. The <code>callback()</code> function is called when the
rules were removed.
</p>

<h3 id="retrievingrules">Retrieving rules</h3>

<p>
To retrieve a list of currently registered rules, call the
<code>getRules()</code> function. It accepts an optional array of rule
identifiers with the same semantics as <code>removeRules</code> and a callback
function.
<p>

<pre>
var rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
function getRules(rule_ids, function callback(details) {...});
</pre>

<p>
The <code>details</code> parameter passed to the <code>calback()</code> function
refers to an array of rules including filled optional parameters.
