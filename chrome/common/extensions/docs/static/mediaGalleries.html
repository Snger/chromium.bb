<p>
The media galleries API allows you to access media files (images,
video, audio) from the user's local disks (with the user's consent).
</p>

<p>
Using the API, you can prompt the user for permission to access the media
galleries. The permission dialog will contain common media locations for
the platform and will allow the user to add additional locations. From those
locations, only media files will be present in the file system objects.
</P>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>You must declare the type of access to the media gallery you require
in your extension's manifest to use the API.  Currently only the
"mediaGalleriesRead" permission is allowed.  This permission does not
currently trigger an install time permission prompt because it requires
the user to grant permission at runtime.</p>

<p>
You may also specify the "mediaGalleriesAllGalleries" permission to get
access to all auto-detected media galleries on the user's computer.  This
permission displays an install time prompt indicating that the extension
will have access to all of the user's media files.
