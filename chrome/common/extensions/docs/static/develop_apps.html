This documentation tells you how to write packaged apps.
You want to write bleeding edge apps, right?
You should know that this is a developer preview release.
What does that mean? Packaged apps are changing.
Anything you read now might be different tomorrow,
so check the docs.
</p>

<p>
This is a work-in-progress doc set,
so let us know if we've missed anything and
how we can make them better.
</p>

<p class="caution">
<b>Note:</b>
If you've written packaged apps before,
your <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/apps.html">legacy packaged apps</a>
will still work the way they always have,
but they won't have access to the new APIs.
</p>

<h2 id="version">Doc version</h2>

<p>
This is the first version of the packaged apps docs,
so there is only one version.
<p>If you're familiar with early versions of the Chrome extension docs,
then you've seen "trunk" in your doc URLs:
<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/overview.html">.../extensions/<b>trunk/</b>...</a>
All packaged apps docs are all delivered to <strong>trunk</strong>:
<code>.../trunk/apps/about_apps.html</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="start">Where to start</h2>

<p>
The <a href="about_apps.html">Getting Started chapter</a> seems like the obvious place to start.
It's fast reading; shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to read all three docs.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="app_lifecycle.html">Fundamentals chapter</a>and
<a href="app_frameworks.html">MVC Architecture</a> are a little meatier,
so feel free to skip around and read what interests you.
We've got lots of sample code in our repository,
and as much as possible, the docs link to relevant samples.
Look for these notes at the top of the docs,
and go straight to the code:
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>API Samples: </b>
Want to play with the code?
Check out these samples (with links to relevant samples).
</p>

<p>
If you're familiar with the Chrome extension docs,
then the Reference docs should seem familiar.
Packaged apps and extensions share a common platform.
They can access many of the same APIs,
they have the same manifest and permissions format.
Many of the reference docs are shared;
we've filtered accessibility to docs that aren't shared.
