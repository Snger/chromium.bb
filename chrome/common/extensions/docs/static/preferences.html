<p id="classSummary">
The <code>chrome.preferences</code> module contains a prototype for giving other
modules access to manage preferences stored by Chrome. This prototype is used,
for example, for <a
  href="proxy.html#property-settings"><code>chrome.proxy.settings</code></a>.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Overview</h2>

<p>
The preferences API provides a common set of functions
(<code>get()</code>, <code>set()</code>, and <code>clear()</code>) as
well as an event publisher (<code>onChange</code>) for various
preferences in Chrome. The <a href="proxy.html#overview-examples">proxy settings
 examples</a> demonstrate how these functions are intended to be used.
</p>

<!--
<h2 id="lifecycle">Life cycle of preferences</h2>

<p>
The life cycle of preferences depends on whether they are set for regular or
incognito profiles. </p>
-->

<p>
Currently, preferences can only be set for regular profiles. Once set, they
remain in place until they are cleared by the governing extension, or the
governing extension is disabled or uninstalled.
</p>

<h2 id="precedence">Precedence</h2>

<p>
Chrome manages preferences on different layers. The following list describes the
layers that may influence the effective preferences, in increasing order of
precedence.
<ol>
  <li>System preferences provided by the operating system</li>
  <li>Command-line parameters</li>
  <li>Preferences set by extensions</li>
  <li>Policies</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
As the list implies, policies might overrule any changes that you specify with
your extension.
</p>

<!--
<p>
As discussed above, Chrome allows using different preferences for regular
windows and incognito windows. The following example illustrates the behavior.
Assume that no policy overrides the preferences and that an extension can set
preferences for regular windows <b>(R)</b> and preferences for incognito windows
<b>(I)</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>If only <b>(R)</b> is set, these preferences are effective for both
  regular and incognito windows.</li>
  <li>If only <b>(I)</b> is set, these preferences are effective for only
  incognito windows. Regular windows use the preferences determined by the lower
  layers (command-line options and system settings).</li>
  <li>If both <b>(R)</b> and <b>(I)</b> are set, the respective preferences are
  used for regular and incognito windows.</li>
</ul>
</p>
-->

<p>
If two or more extensions want to set the same preference to different values,
the extension installed most recently takes precedence over the other
extensions.
<!-- If the
extension installed last sets only <b>(I)</b>, the preference of regular windows
can be defined by previously installed extensions. -->
</p>

<p>
The <em>effective</em> preference value is the setting that results from
considering the preference rules. It is used by Chrome.
