Overview

This is a Google App Engine server which serves the documentation for Chrome
apps and extensions. At time of this writing, the primary URL is:
http://developer.chrome.com/.

Documentation for Chrome apps and extensions is partly generated from API
definitions (for the reference material), and partly hand-written.

All documentation sources are checked into source control, just like any other
Chrome source code. The server consumes these sources and generates the
documentation web pages dynamically.

The goals of this system are:

* Docs are generated from API definitions; it isn't possible to add or modify
  APIs without creating stub reference documentation at the same time.

* Docs are editable by anyone with Chrome commit access. This encourages
  developers to do their part to keep doc up to date, and allows part-time
  contributors to help too.

* Docs go live automatically and immediately, upon check-in. There's no separate
  push process for docs.

* Docs are branched automatically with Chrome's source code; the docs for each
  Chrome release are kept with the corresponding source code.

* Users can always find the current doc for any Chrome release channel (i.e.,
  /trunk/extensions/, /beta/apps/, etc.). These URLs are updated automatically
  with Chrome's release process.


Editing Docs

  1. Edit files.

     - They will mostly be in chrome/common/extensions/api/ or
       chrome/common/extensions/docs/server2/templates/.

     - Files in templates directory use the Handlebar template language. It is
       extremely simple. See third_party/handlebar/README.md.

  2. Run './preview.py'

  3. Check your work at http://localhost:8000/(apps|extensions)/<doc_name>

  4. Send a CL and commit files as with any other Chrome change. The live
     server will update within 5-10 minutes.


Developing the Server

You shouldn't need app engine locally to develop the server, preview.py should
be sufficient. If for some reason you want to test against the app engine SDK:

  1. Download the python Google App Engine SDK from:
     https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads

  2. Run './start_dev_server.py <path/to/dev_appserver.py>'
     (dev_appserver.py is part of the App Engine)

  3. View docs at http://localhost:8080/(apps|extensions)/<doc_name>


Deploying the Server

You will need to have access to the http://chrome-apps-doc.appspot.com app.
Contact aa@chromium.org, erikkay@chromium.org, mihaip@chromium.org, or
miket@chromium.org to obtain access.

Once you have access:

1. Increment the version in app.yaml so we can roll back if the update breaks.

2. Run build_server.py. This copies some depenencies from /third_party into the
   server directory so that they get uploaded to App Engine.

3. Run appcfg.py (supplied with the App Engine SDK) to upload the server code:

    appcfg.py update .

4. When prompted for your credentials, enter the information for the account
   that has access to the production app.

5. Go to http://www.appspot.com, select the docs project, click "versions" in
   the sidebar, and make the version you just deployed the "default" version.

   If you get an error about too many versions when deploying, go into this
   view and delete the version which was deployed the longest time ago.  Then
   try to deploy again.
