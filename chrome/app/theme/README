When adding a new icon please follow these two steps:

Step 1. Run pngcrush on all new icons. For example:
  mkdir crushed
  pngcrush -d crushed -brute -reduce new/*.png

Step 2. While adding an icon to one of the following files:
  theme_resources_standard.grd
  theme_resources_2x.grd
  theme_resources_touch_1x.grd
  theme_resources_touch_2x.grd
make sure to add the same icon to all the other .grd files.
Verify that you did this correctly by doing a diff of the generated header
files. For example:
  diff Debug/gen/chrome/grit/theme_resources_standard.h \
  Debug/gen/chrome/grit/theme_resources_2x.h
should be empty.
