# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Chromium code of conduct](
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in
our our repos and organizations, mailing lists, and other communications.

# Workflow

Install [depot_tools]
(https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools).

Then checkout the catapult repo.

`git clone https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult.git`

You can then create a local branch, make and commit your change.

```
cd catapult
git checkout -t -b foo origin/master
... edit files ...
git commit -a -m "New files"
```

Once you're ready for a review do:

`git cl upload`

Once uploaded you can view the CL in Rietveld and request a review by clicking
the 'publish & mail' link. You can also click the "CQ Dry Run" link to run all
the tests on your change.

If you get review feedback, edit and commit locally and then do another upload
with the new files. Before you commit you'll want to sync to the tip-of-tree.
You can either merge or rebase, it's up to you.

Then, submit your changes through the commit queue by checking the "Commit" box.

Once everything is landed, you can cleanup your branch.

```
git checkout master
git branch -D foo
```

# Legal

If you're new to the chromium-family of projects, you will also need to sign the
chrome contributors license agreement. You can sign the
[Contributor License Agreement]
(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual?csw=1), which you can
do online.
It only takes a minute. If you are contributing on behalf of a corporation, you
must fill out the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement]
(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate?csw=1) and send it to
us as described on that page.

If you've never submitted code before, you must add your (or your
organization's) name and contact info to the Chromium AUTHORS file.

# Contributing from a Chromium checkout

If you already have catapult checked out as part of a Chromium checkout and want
to edit it in place (instead of having a separate clone of the repository), you
will probably want to disconnect it from gclient at this point so that it
doesn't do strange things on updating. This is done by editing the .gclient file
for your Chromium checkout and adding the following lines:

```
'custom_deps': {
    'src/third_party/catapult': None,
},
```

In order to be able to land patches, you will most likely need to update the
`origin` remote in your catapult checkout to point directly to this GitHub
repository. You can do this by executing the following command inside the
catapult folder (third_party/catapult):

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:catapult-project/catapult`

# Code style

We follow the [Chromium style]
(https://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style).

If you're contributing to Trace Viewer, refer to the [Trace Viewer style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMOfywou2Oaho4jOttUk-ZSJcHVd5G5BTsD48rPrBtQ/edit).

# Individual project documentation

Look to individual project documentation for more info on getting started:
   * [lighthouse](/lighthouse/README.md)
   * [perf dashboard](/dashboard/README.md)
   * [systrace](/systrace/README.md)
   * [telemetry](/telemetry/README.md)
   * [trace-viewer](/tracing/README.md)

# Tests

Check individual project documentation for instructions on how to run tests.
You can also check the current status of our tests on the
[waterfall](http://build.chromium.org/p/client.catapult/waterfall).
Use the "commit" checkbox in rietveld to commit through the commit queue, which
automatically runs all tests. Run the tests before committing with the
"CQ dry run" link.

# Updating Chromium's about:tracing (rolling DEPS)

Chromium's DEPS file needs to be rolled to the catapult revision containing your
change in order for it to appear in Chrome's about:tracing or other
third_party/catapult files. This should happen automatically, but you may need
to do it manually in rare cases. See below for more details.

## Automatic rolls

DEPS should be automatically rolled by the auto-roll bot at
[catapult-roll.skia.org](https://catapult-roll.skia.org/).
[catapult-sheriff@chromium.org](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/catapult-sheriff)
will be cc-ed on all reviews, and anyone who wants to join that list can
subscribe. It's also the correct list to report a problem with the autoroll. If
you need to stop the autoroll, either sign into that page with a google.com
account, or contact catapult-sheriff@chromium.org.

## Manual rolls

In rare cases, you may need to make changes to chromium at the same time as you
roll catapult DEPs. In this case you would need to do a manual roll. Here are
instructions for rolling catapult DEPS, your CL would also include any other
changes to chromium needed to complete the roll.

First, commit to catapult. Then check the [mirror]
(https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/catapult-project/catapult.git)
to find the git hash of your commit. (Note: it may take a few minutes to be
mirrored).

Then edit Chrome's [src/DEPS]
(https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/DEPS) file. Look for
a line like:

```
  'src/third_party/catapult':
    Var('chromium_git') + '/external/github.com/catapult-project/catapult.git' + '@' +
    '2da8924915bd6fb7609c518f5b1f63cb606248eb',
```

Update the number to the git hash you want to roll to, and [contribute a
codereview to chrome](http://www.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code)
for your edit. If you are a Chromium committer, feel free to TBR this.

# Adding contributors

Admins (nduca, sullivan) can add contributors to the project. There are two
steps:

1.  Add the person's github account to the [catapult]
(https://github.com/orgs/catapult-project/teams/catapult) team.
2.  Add the person's email to the [commit queue list]
(https://chrome-infra-auth.appspot.com/auth/groups#project-catapult-committers).

Because there is no API to retrieve a person's GitHub ID from their email
address or vice versa, we cannot automate this into one step.
