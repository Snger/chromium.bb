This directory contains a copy of xdg-utils obtained from CVS on 2009-07-27,
with this command:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/portland co -d xdg-utils portland/xdg-utils

The .cvsignore files were converted to svn:ignore properties to check it in.

It has been modified to add the xdg-settings command for getting and, in some
cases, setting various GNU/Linux desktop environment settings like the default
web browser and proxy configuration.

The license for xdg-utils is in the LICENSE file and is similar to BSD-style.
